Stephen understood exactly what I needed in order to have a foundation for my assignment, he provided clean, functional and easy to understand code. I honestly am super happy, and If I run into anymore issues learning processing or java, i'm definitely hitting up Stephen. He did more than he was asked for, if I wasn't a student, I would easily give him more money. He deserves it, truthfully.",
